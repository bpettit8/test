             One thing you may have heard of, however, are the following Fortnite pro mega gamers </p>
             <ol>
                 <li>Ninja</li>
                 <li>Big Chungus</li>
                 <li>Goofy John</li>
             </ol>

             <p>
                 You'll want to make sure that you are familiar with them, they are the greatest mega Johns that the Fortnite space
                 has ever seen. They get the number one victory royale, yeah Fortnite we 'bout to get down (Get down!) 10 kills on the
                 board right now, just squad wiped Tomato Town.
             </p>
             <p>
                 One of the things you Johns have to remember is that if you ever find one of these guys in the wild, you are gonna
                 get cooked son! The best thing you can try to do is trap that little fishy and then smack him down. Consider the
                 following methods of getting the little fishies trapped
             </p>
             <ul>
                 <li>Spike trap -- an absolute classic</li>
                 <li>Golden scar on the floor -- double pump that John when he tries to pick it up!</li>
                 <li>And now for the most powerful: THE BOOGIE BOMB</li>
                 <img src="img/Boogie_Bomb_John.jpg" alt="A big boy biggy john doing the Boogie Bomb">
                 <ul>
                     <li>Sussy boogie</li>
                     <li>Biggy boogie</li>
                     <li>Small John boogie</li>
                 </ul>
             </ul>
             <p>
                 The boogie bomb is the single greatest fishy killer of all time. Bring your prey in for the trap and then drop
                 those Johns on the floor. Default dance on those SUCKAHz and then get that sweet sweet loot and booty. <br>
                 Get all of this going and you may just end up with that Victory Roayle in no time Buster
